# Skill-Bid

## Overview
A web based application that allows users to list a service/need and have potential freelance workers bid on their project/listing.
A homepage that displays all active listings and has a filter/search to sort for more specific items based on the users capabilities.
Users will be allowed to click on the listing(s) and bid on them as long as they are currently signed in with their account. 
Users can post listings and provide images|description|title|price|time-frame.
Bidders can contact the original poster with any inquiries.

## SWOT Anylsis
Strength:
We have a group of strong team players and are centered around communication and effecieny. 

Weakness:
We're new to the backend and still have a lot to learn with that aspect of the project as well as the css.

Opportunity:
Showcasing the ability to work in a group for the first time and successfully create a fullstack application.

Threat:
This will be our first ever group project so there will be a learning curve throughout the process.
